            <h4>The purpose of the original Enjoy webstie is to introduce the service, and help the users use their service. Since it is already a design that has been implemented and being used, I thought the best way to approach the redesign process is through user interviews and heuristic analysis, for the existing website. 

Interview method: Speak out your thoughts: People I already know, speak their thoughts as they experience the user interface. Thoughts and actions can truly show the effectiveness of Interface design and whether the ui flow is working properly. I also asked them to purchase a product through enjoy.

•	Very amused by the infographics
•	Had no idea what product they sold, or affiliated with. 
•	Didn’t like how it’s listed by companies, (For someone who’s not familiar with it, doesn’t make sense to list it by companies
•	When asked a question, they went to Sonos. Some questions were “Do I have to sign in?” and what not. 
•	At the purchase page they were directed to, it simply said home delivery, not Sonos. Said he won’t use it because of the lack of direction.

•	Doubted about the 30 minute delivery
•	Never heard of the companies before, so did not use what products they sold.

                <div class="archetype">Got bored of the video midway, because he expected it to actually tell him how it worked. 
•	Was curious as to why same-day delivery is needed, since many high-end tech-products are bought after many days of research and consideration.
•	Also confused about the company lsiting.
•	Liked the “personal” people
•	Didn’t read the description on the left when purchasing. Confused about the activation of Enjoy.
•	Wanted to know about the target audience and demographics

                <h3 style="line-height:1.2">People loved the front-page video, but hardly ever clicked on "See how it works". unnecessary element should be deleted  </h3>

                <h3 style="line-height:1.2">The infographic was understood very well by all users. No change is needed. </h3>
                <h2 style="color:#f5b144;font-weight:500;">4. Where we deliver</h2>
                <h3 style="line-height:1.2">The card slide on the right column was never used by the users. Sliding through numerous delivery locations seemed inefficient. The information would be presented more effectively when users can see all the delivery locations in one block. Search block on the left column can remain the same.</h3><h2 style="color:#f5b144;font-weight:500;">5. Our experts &amp; </h2>
                <h2 style="color:#f5b144;font-weight:500;">6. Our customers</h2>
                <h3 style="line-height:1.2">Users never swiped more than three expert/customer profiles, and many users found them  unrelatable. In order to increase the chace of users seeing a relatable profile, three default profiles that represent distinct demographics could be displayed. Other expert/customer profiles can be shown at the buttom as thumbnails, with an option to view more.  </h3>

                <h3 style="line-height:1.2">One of the major issuess with the orignal design was the shopping interface Users with no previous knowledge on the brand could not figure out which items were available. Most of the users watned to see different products in one page, instead of brands. To make the whole shopping experience more intuitive, I added a seprate page dedicated to purchasing items. </h3>

                <h2 style="color:#f5b144;font-weight:500;">11. Purchase instructions</h2>
                <h3 style="line-height:1.2">The most confusing interface in the previous design was the actual purchasing. Becuase different brands had their own website and user interface, a lot of the users found it difficult to apply Enjoy service, or simply did not know if it had been activated. In fact, half of the users failed to activate Enjoy correctly. Displaying instructions on how to apply Enjoy service for that specific brand, before users get redirected to the purchase page, will greatly help the users to make the purchase properly.</h3>
                <h2 style="color:#f5b144;font-weight:500;">11. Customer reviews</h2>
                <h3 style="line-height:1.2">Same as #5 and #6.</h3>
