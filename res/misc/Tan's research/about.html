Professor Tan and the XXXX lab’s work focuses on understanding patterns of youth risk and protective factors, developmental patterns of problem behaviors, and their 6patterns of school victimization and their effect on high school graduation rates, social and environmental risk factors for juvenile sexual abusers, among other topics. 
    </br></br>

Currently, he and the lab are studying patterns of social emotional learning needs in high school students in order to build and roll out multi-tiered interventions to support students and help them reach their full potential. As the lab is early in this line of research, they are focused on the identification part of the theory of change. In the months and years to come, his work will shift toward intervention and monitoring.

    <h2>What are your beliefs as a researcher?
    </h2>
    <h4>I believe my job as a researcher is to turn out cutting-edge research to influence practice and help students. The core of schools and education is helping students develop their full potential, and we need to be as supportive as we can to make that possible.
    </h4>
    <div class="sm-top-padding"></div>
    <h2>Why did you choose this as your research path?
    </h2>
    <h4>Early in my practice, I was working with a group of young men referred by the school to do anger management. There was one specific incident with them that really changed my perspective, and I realized we needed a better way of understanding their needs.</br></br>

The school had recently completed a major renovation and had a large celebration at the school to mark the occasion. When I was leaving that night, I saw the group of young men I worked with angrily standing outside the front gate. When I asked why they weren't at the party, they revealed that they were not allowed to participate in the celebration because the teachers were afraid they would be rowdy and boisterous. The boys were angry because they felt excluded from the event. In that moment, I realized this was really a student-teacher relationship issue rather than an anger management one, and it completely changed my perspective on my work with them. Instead of focusing on managing their behaviors, I focused on looking for ways to enhance their fit and belonging in the school, and it made all the difference

<div class="sm-top-padding"></div>
    <h2>What is unique about your research?

    </h2>
    <h4>Overall, my research focuses on understanding patterns of youth risk and protective factors, developmental patterns of problem behaviors, and their social contextual influences. </br></br>

What is unique about that is looking at patterns of risk rather than assessing for individual needs, which helps place a more holistic lens on identification and intervention. We are all unique in our backgrounds, but there are similar patterns amongst us that can help inform intervention.</br></br>

Currently, I am studying patterns of social-emotional learning needs of high school students. This group is not receiving a lot of research and intervention attention, yet this is the last window of opportunity for intervention before students reach young adulthood. This is an important time of development to intervene and be supportive of students and their needs. </br></br>


In that research, I also look at student perceptions of SEL needs which helps us understand what stories students tell themselves about SEL. High school is an important time to identify and help alter any false stories students may be telling themselves and inhibiting their success in life.

    </h4>
<div class="sm-top-padding"></div>

<h2>Why study social-emotional learning needs?

    </h2>
    <h4>SEL needs have shown to be important factors in whether a student graduates or not. Especially when high school graduation is one of the most important factors in someone's success in life, it's important we support students in every possible way to receive a strong education. Ultimately, targeting problem behaviors in school is about giving students a strong start in life.
